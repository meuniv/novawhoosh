Requirement #3: Simple Machines
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. tip:: Getting started!

	 Just like for any language, you need to learn some basic vocabulary before attempting to write sentences! This is the same for computer programming. Some teachers (including me) believe in pushing this metaphor further by adopting the following procedure:
	 (1) Learn some basic vocabulary so you can start understanding some simple commands
	 (2) Learn by mimicking (that is: study a simple piece of existing code and modify it)
	 (3) Learn more commands and start writing your own codes

	 When I teach computational sciences, I often tell my students: a good programmer is not a person who writes good codes! Rather,  it is a person who can edit their codes to make them work! So, be patient and do not depair if things don't work out the way they are supposed to at first!
	     
:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}`  Do all of the following:

      
A. Make a list or drawing of the six simple machines.
B. Be able to tell your counselor the name of each machine and how each machine works.

C. Discuss the following with your counselor:
   
   (1) The simple machines that were involved with the motion in your chosen merit badge

       .. tip::  Look at the moving parts of an engine to find simple machines.)
		 
   (2) The energy source causing the motion for the subject of your merit badge
   (3) What you learned about motion from earning your merit badge
