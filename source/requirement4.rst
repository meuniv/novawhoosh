.. note:: **The Ferris Wheel**

   The Ferris Wheel is considered one of the greatest engineering wonders in the world. The first Ferris Wheel was created by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania engineer, George W. Ferris, in 1893. He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, in the class of 1881 with a degree in Civil Engineering. The wheel is supported by two 140-foot steel towers and connected by a 45-foot axle â€” the largest single piece of forged steel ever made at that time. You can lean more about it by visiting the following engineerng4kids.com `website <https://engineering4kids.org/2019/01/27/ferris-wheel-2/>__`.

   Picture of the Eiffel Tower, obtained from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower>`__. Visit that website for more information! The website provides the following fun facts: The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. 


.. note:: **The Atomium**

   The Atomium was constructed for the first post-war universal world exhibition (EXPO 1958) The nine spheres represent an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times. They represent the faith one had in the power of science and moreover in nuclear power. The Atomium offers today: a surrealistic walk through tubes and spheres. Many people get confused, due in large part to the choice of the name of the structure. Indeed, the *Atomium* is really a representation of a collection of 9 atoms, forming a piece of iron crystal where atomas are regulalry arranged on a lattice.

   The Easy Sciecnce for Kids `website <https://easyscienceforkids.com/atomium-building-facts/>`__ provides lots of information on this landmark structure from Brussels, Belgium. (1) The diameter of each sphere is 18 meters; (2) The distance between the spheres is about 30 meters; (3) The total height of the structure is 102 meters and the total mass is 2,400 tons; (4) There is a restaurant at the top sphere that has a capacity for 140 guests; (5) It was not originally designed to be a permanent structure.
