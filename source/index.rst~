.. note:: What is **Engineering**?
	  
   Engineering is the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures.

   Engineering is the application of science and math to solve problems. Engineers figure out how things work and find practical uses for scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get the credit for innovations that advance the human condition, but it is engineers who are instrumental in making those innovations available to the world  (definition adapted from this `website <https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html>`__.)
