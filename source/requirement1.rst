Requirement #1: Research and Reading
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: What is **Engineering**?
	  
   Engineering is the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures.

   Engineering is the application of science and math to solve problems. Engineers figure out how things work and find practical uses for scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get the credit for innovations that advance the human condition, but it is engineers who are instrumental in making those innovations available to the world  (definition adapted from this `website <https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html>`__.)

   There are different types of engineering, and we will discuss more about them in this module. Specialty areas include:
      
   * Mechanical engineering 
   * Electrical engineering 
   * Civil engineering 
   * Aerospace engineering 
   * Nuclear engineering 
   * Structural engineering
   * Biomedical engineering 
   * Computer engineering
   * Industrial engineering 
   * Environmental engineering

      A good engineer is a good problem solver! This requires a good knowledge of math and science, along with creativity! (Image copied from this `website <https://www.livescience.com/47499-what-is-engineering.html>`__.)

:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}`  Choose A or B or C and complete ALL the requirements.

      
A. Watch about three hours total of engineering-related shows or documentaries that involve motion or motion-inspired technology. Then do the following:

   (1) Make a list of at least five questions or ideas from the show(s) you watched.
   (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.
      
   .. tip:: Some examples include - but are not limited to - shows found on PBS ("NOVA"), Discovery Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic Channel, TED Talks (online videos), and the History Channel. You may choose to watch a live performance or movie at a planetarium or science museum instead of watching a media production. You may watch online productions with your counselor's approval and under your parent's supervision. One example is the NOVA Lever an Obelisk page on ancient Egypt and the use of levers, available `here <http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/lever.html>`__. 

	    Examples of magazines include - but are not limited to - Odyssey, Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Science Illustrated, Discover, Air & Space, Popular Astronomy Astronomy, Science News, Sky & Telescope, Natural History, Robot, Servo, Nuts and Volts, and Scientific American


B. Read (about three hours total) about motion or motion-inspired technology. Then do the following:

   (1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article.
   (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.

C. Do a combination of reading and watching (about three hours total). Then do the following:

   (1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article or show.
   (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.

.. attention:: Once you have completed this requirement, make sure you document it in your worksheet!
